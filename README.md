# Building_Escape
An escape-room game created with Unreal Engine 4.22, Visual Studio Code, and C++ as part of GameDev.tv's Unreal Engine C++ Developer course. The player had to escape a room by placing an object in a specific part of said room which would open the doors in the level long enough for the player to escape.
